## 2. Spring Application
"The Spring application, named "tracing-demo," is a microservice-based application that demonstrates the use of distributed tracing. The application includes several REST endpoints that simulate different types of service interactions.

Distributed tracing is enabled in the application by integrating the Zipkin and Cloud Sleuth libraries. Zipkin is used for data collection and storage, while Cloud Sleuth provides an abstraction layer for instrumenting the application code. This allows for tracing the flow of requests and responses through the different microservices in the application.

The application's functionality can be broken down into several key features:

- Tracing data: The application is configured to send tracing data to the Zipkin server, which is then used to generate traces.

- Cloud Sleuth: Cloud Sleuth is used to abstract the instrumentation of the application code, making it easier to add tracing to the application.

This Spring application serves as a demonstration of how to effectively implement distributed tracing in a microservice-based application using Zipkin and Cloud Sleuth. By using these libraries, it is possible to gain insights into the flow of requests and responses through the different microservices and troubleshoot issues more effectively."





## 3. CI/CD pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline for the "tracing-demo" application is built using Jenkins. Jenkins is used for automating the build and deployment process, ensuring that the application is always up-to-date and stable.

The pipeline includes the following stages:

- Build: Jenkins is configured to build the application using the Gradle build tool. This includes compiling the code and running any necessary tests.

- Docker Image: Jenkins is also used to create a Docker image of the application. This allows for easy deployment to a Kubernetes cluster.

- Push to Docker Repo: Once the Docker image is created, it is pushed to a Docker repository for storage and later deployment.

- Deployment: ArgoCD is used for deploying the application to the Kubernetes cluster. This includes creating the necessary Kubernetes resources such as pods, services and ingress.

By using Jenkins and ArgoCD, this project provides a streamlined and automated approach for building and deploying the application. This ensures that the application is always up-to-date and stable, and can be easily scaled up or down as needed.

## 4. Monitoring and Tracing
Monitoring and tracing are critical for understanding the behavior of a distributed system and troubleshooting issues. This project utilizes the Jaegar and Prometheus-Grafana stack for monitoring and tracing the "tracing-demo" application.

- Jaegar: Jaegar is an open-source, end-to-end distributed tracing platform that allows to identify and troubleshoot issues in a distributed system. The traces are sent to the Jaeger server, which provides a visualization of the traces and helps to troubleshoot issues in the distributed system.

- Prometheus-Grafana: Prometheus is used for collecting and storing metrics, while Grafana is used for creating dashboards to visualize the metrics. The metrics can be used to understand the performance of the application and identify any potential issues.

- Dashboard: A custom dashboard is created to visualize the traces in Jaegar at a specific time frame. This allows developers to quickly identify and troubleshoot issues in the distributed system.

By using Jaegar and Prometheus-Grafana, this project provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring and troubleshooting the "tracing-demo" application. The traces and metrics collected can be used to understand the behavior of the application and identify any potential issues.

## 5. Alerting
In addition to monitoring and tracing, this project also includes an alerting system to notify developers of any issues that may arise in the "tracing-demo" application. Alertmanager is used to send alerts via email when certain conditions are met.

- Alertmanager: Alertmanager is an open-source tool that can be used to manage alerts generated by Prometheus. It can be configured to send alerts to different channels such as email, slack, etc. based on the alerting rules defined.

- Alerting rules: Alerting rules can be configured to trigger alerts when certain conditions are met. For example, if the CPU usage of a pod exceeds a certain threshold, an alert can be sent to notify the developers.

- Email notifications: Alertmanager is configured to send email notifications to the developers when an alert is triggered. These notifications can be used to quickly identify and troubleshoot issues in the application.

By using Alertmanager, this project provides a flexible and efficient way to notify developers of any issues that may arise in the "tracing-demo" application, allowing them to quickly identify and troubleshoot issues.
